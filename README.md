A digital calculator built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a straightforward, interactive web application that mimics the functionality of a physical calculator. Here’s a breakdown of its structure and features:

Structure
HTML: This serves as the skeleton of the calculator, organizing its layout and structure. Typically, it includes buttons for digits (0–9), operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), a clear/reset button, and an equal sign for result calculation. An <input> or <div> element displays the current calculation or result.

CSS: CSS styles the calculator, giving it a visually appealing design and improving the user experience. This can include defining button sizes, colors, shadows, hover effects, and layouts. CSS Grid or Flexbox can be used to position the buttons and display area cleanly, making the calculator responsive and user-friendly.

JavaScript: JavaScript is the logic layer, handling the calculator's functional operations. It captures user inputs, processes mathematical operations, and updates the display with the result. JavaScript can track the state of the current input, manage operations, handle decimal points, and clear/reset operations. Event listeners are added to the buttons to respond to user clicks and to perform calculations in real time.

Features
Basic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clear/Reset: A button to clear the current calculation or reset the calculator.
Responsive Design: Ensures usability across different screen sizes.
Input Validation: Prevents invalid operations (like division by zero) and restricts multiple decimal points in a single number.
Example User Experience
Users can input numbers by clicking buttons or pressing keyboard keys (if added as a feature), perform operations, and see results displayed in real time, creating a simple, efficient tool that demonstrates practical JavaScript-based interactivity.
